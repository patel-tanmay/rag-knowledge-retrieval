The high prevalence of non-CP-CRE resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam prompted investigations into alternative antibiotics for the effective management of ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant non-CP-CRE infections. Using the susceptibility breakpoints for Enterobacterales recommended by CLSI 2025 (for ceftazidime-avibactam, amikacin and meropenem-vaborbactam), EUCAST 2025 (for aztreonam-avibactam, colistin) and the US FDA (for tigecycline), susceptibility data of key antibiotics against global ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant non-CP-CRE isolates were extracted from the 2020-23 Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance database.

It involves all measures aiming at preventing disease-causing agents from entering the farm (external biosecurity) and those measures practiced with the aim of preventing the spread of disease-causing organisms within the farm (internal biosecurity). However, their implementation is often limited in low-income countries due to various factors such as socioeconomic challenges, farming practices and limited resources. The aim of this study was to explore the current biosecurity levels and their related factors in commercial layer chicken farms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 203 randomly selected commercial layer farms with ≥ 200 birds across Dar es Salaam (n = 154), Morogoro (n = 28), and Unguja (n = 21) regions from March-June 2023.

We analyzed Scopus-indexed publications using controlled vocabulary for BPaL/BPaLM regimens. From 551 initial records, 120 met inclusion criteria after screening. Bibliometrix and VOS Viewer software evaluated publication trends, authorship, institutional/geographical contributions, citations, and keyword networks. Visualization tools mapped collaborations and thematic clusters, while statistical methods assessed growth rates and citation impacts. The study identified 1,081 authors, with publications growing at 11.61",

Critically, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) Candidozyma duobushaemulonii (also known as Candida duobushaemulonii) poses critical challenges to antifungal therapy. Here, in this comparative study, we analyzed four clinical C. duobushaemulonii isolates (cd, cd1, cd2, and cd3) to establish strain-specific virulence and antifungal resistance profiles. Biofilm quantification using crystal violet (CV) and 2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) metabolic activity assays showed different biomass production levels across strains. Cellular aggregation capacity differed significantly, while cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) showed inverse patterns.

This case underscores the importance of considering CM in the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, even in patients without overt immunosuppression. Understanding such atypical presentations is crucial for timely diagnosis, guiding effective treatment strategies, and improving outcomes in immunocompetent individuals affected by CM.",

Multivariate analysis of 17,482 hypertensive patients demonstrated that APAP use was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality (hazard ratios [HR] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.46-0.67, P < .001).

Efficacy trials have demonstrated the superiority of HDF over high-flux hemodialysis in terms of solute removal, hemodynamic tolerance, and survival.

Clinically, such adversity often arises from being of a lower socioeconomic status and may contribute to health disparities in cardiometabolic and affective disorders. To develop a better understanding of the cardiometabolic consequences of social adversity, we employ chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in adult male mice. CSDS results in increases in body mass, that are accompanied by elevated lean and fluid mass, as well as several somatic indices of chronic stress.

This report presents a 33-year-old man with an obvious pheochromocytoma crisis that occurred due to beta-blocker application without a concomitant alpha-blocker. The crisis was treated with high doses of urapidil, and once permanent hemodynamic stabilization was achieved, urapidil was replaced with phenoxybenzamine. This report demonstrates that pheochromocytoma crisis can be successfully treated with urapidil but further consideration is needed on the use of urapidil both in pheochromocytoma crisis and preoperative management of pheochromocytoma patients.",
