2025-10-07 12:55:29,What are current challenges in combating antimicrobial resistance?,"Current challenges in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) include the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, which threaten modern medical procedures such as surgery, chemotherapy, and organ transplantation. Conventional antibiotics are increasingly limited due to mechanisms like target-site mutations, efflux mechanisms, enzymatic degradation, and biofilm-associated tolerance. Additionally, inappropriate antimicrobial use accelerates AMR, creating tensions between antimicrobial stewardship and timely treatment, with persistent gaps between recommendations and practice due to systemic factors in clinical settings. Furthermore, there is a notable shift in infections from staphylococcal dominance to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and fungi, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which report higher infection rates and greater burdens of Gram-negative pathogens [Source 1][Source 2][Source 3].",0.584,"[{""title"": ""Pseudomonas spp. and antimicrobial resistance: unlocking new horizons with 1-hydroxyphenazine."", ""url"": ""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41045408/"", ""score"": 0.61}, {""title"": ""The latent system factors that influence antimicrobial use and governance in healthcare: a scoping review of high-income health systems."", ""url"": ""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41048667/"", ""score"": 0.575}, {""title"": ""Evolving Patterns of Etiological Profiles and Susceptibility Trends of Healthcare-Associated Infections Since Inception: A Meta-Analysis."", ""url"": ""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41050025/"", ""score"": 0.568}]"
